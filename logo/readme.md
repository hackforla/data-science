# Hack for LA Data Science Logos

The current, extremely simple Data Science Logos were made in Google Drawing. The editable files can be found in the [Google Drive folder here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1d0IrLzTGEWP5PkGS0aocLi1tCK2jSt8b) for those with the right permissions. Alternate versions are saved in the edit history of the Google Drawing file, as well as in the github repo at /data-science/logo/Drafts.
