### What changes did you make?
- Adding Workshop-Feedback_Bigram_Analysis.ipynb from access-the-data repo (commit: https://github.com/hackforla/access-the-data/commit/62609601277509b0473bbf8f6dbf1ef735430c84) to this repo

### Why did you make the changes?
- Requested by Bonnie per [this comment](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/5127#issuecomment-1776306588)
- AJ Price, Access the Data's PM, didn't want Jupyter Notebook to show up as a Language for the project, so Bonnie recommended moving the Workshop-Feedback_Bigram_Analysis.ipynb file to the Data Science repo.

### Additional Notes
- I recommend using rebase merging to preserve who authored the file.
- To see examples of the commit history of the various methods of merging, see these branches in my forked repo:
  - [Using rebase & merge](https://github.com/JessicaLucindaCheng/data-science/commits/rebase-merge): Recommended
  - [Using merge commit](https://github.com/JessicaLucindaCheng/data-science/commits/merge-commit): Okay but results in 2 commits

<summary>Changelog</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/blob/main/CHANGELOG.rst"">cryptography's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>39.0.1 - 2023-02-07</p>
<pre><code>
* **SECURITY ISSUE** - Fixed a bug where ``Cipher.update_into`` accepted Python
  buffer protocol objects, but allowed immutable buffers. **CVE-2023-23931**
* Updated Windows, macOS, and Linux wheels to be compiled with OpenSSL 3.0.8.
<p>.. _v39-0-0:</p>
<p>39.0.0 - 2023-01-01
</code></pre></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:</strong> Support for OpenSSL 1.1.0 has been removed.
Users on older version of OpenSSL will need to upgrade.</li>
<li><strong>BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:</strong> Dropped support for LibreSSL &lt; 3.5. The new
minimum LibreSSL version is 3.5.0. Going forward our policy is to support
versions of LibreSSL that are available in versions of OpenBSD that are
still receiving security support.</li>
<li><strong>BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:</strong> Removed the <code>encode_point</code> and
<code>from_encoded_point</code> methods on
:class:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePublicNumbers</code>,
which had been deprecated for several years.
:meth:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePublicKey.public_bytes</code>
and
:meth:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePublicKey.from_encoded_point</code>
should be used instead.</li>
<li><strong>BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:</strong> Support for using MD5 or SHA1 in
:class:<code>~cryptography.x509.CertificateBuilder</code>, other X.509 builders, and
PKCS7 has been removed.</li>
<li><strong>BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:</strong> Dropped support for macOS 10.10 and 10.11, macOS
users must upgrade to 10.12 or newer.</li>
<li><strong>ANNOUNCEMENT:</strong> The next version of <code>cryptography</code> (40.0) will change
the way we link OpenSSL. This will only impact users who build
<code>cryptography</code> from source (i.e., not from a <code>wheel</code>), and specify their
own version of OpenSSL. For those users, the <code>CFLAGS</code>, <code>LDFLAGS</code>,
<code>INCLUDE</code>, <code>LIB</code>, and <code>CRYPTOGRAPHY_SUPPRESS_LINK_FLAGS</code> environment
variables will no longer be respected. Instead, users will need to
configure their builds <code>as documented here</code>_.</li>
<li>Added support for
:ref:<code>disabling the legacy provider in OpenSSL 3.0.x&lt;legacy-provider&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Added support for disabling RSA key validation checks when loading RSA
keys via
:func:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.load_pem_private_key</code>,
:func:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.load_der_private_key</code>,
and
:meth:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.rsa.RSAPrivateNumbers.private_key</code>.
This speeds up key loading but is :term:<code>unsafe</code> if you are loading potentially
attacker supplied keys.</li>
<li>Significantly improved performance for
:class:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead.ChaCha20Poly1305</code></li>

<h2>v1.22.0</h2>
<h1>NumPy 1.22.0 Release Notes</h1>
<p>NumPy 1.22.0 is a big release featuring the work of 153 contributors
spread over 609 pull requests. There have been many improvements,
highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annotations of the main namespace are essentially complete. Upstream
is a moving target, so there will likely be further improvements,
but the major work is done. This is probably the most user visible
enhancement in this release.</li>
<li>A preliminary version of the proposed Array-API is provided. This is
a step in creating a standard collection of functions that can be
used across application such as CuPy and JAX.</li>
<li>NumPy now has a DLPack backend. DLPack provides a common interchange
format for array (tensor) data.</li>
<li>New methods for <code>quantile</code>, <code>percentile</code>, and related functions. The
new methods provide a complete set of the methods commonly found in
the literature.</li>
<li>A new configurable allocator for use by downstream projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are in addition to the ongoing work to provide SIMD support for
commonly used functions, improvements to F2PY, and better documentation.</p>
<p>The Python versions supported in this release are 3.8-3.10, Python 3.7
has been dropped. Note that 32 bit wheels are only provided for Python
3.8 and 3.9 on Windows, all other wheels are 64 bits on account of
Ubuntu, Fedora, and other Linux distributions dropping 32 bit support.
All 64 bit wheels are also linked with 64 bit integer OpenBLAS, which should fix
the occasional problems encountered by folks using truly huge arrays.</p>
<h2>Expired deprecations</h2>
<h3>Deprecated numeric style dtype strings have been removed</h3>
<p>Using the strings <code>&quot;Bytes0&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Datetime64&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Str0&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Uint32&quot;</code>,
and <code>&quot;Uint64&quot;</code> as a dtype will now raise a <code>TypeError</code>.</p>
<p>(<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19539"">gh-19539</a>)</p>
<h3>Expired deprecations for <code>loads</code>, <code>ndfromtxt</code>, and <code>mafromtxt</code> in npyio</h3>
<p><code>numpy.loads</code> was deprecated in v1.15, with the recommendation that
users use <code>pickle.loads</code> instead. <code>ndfromtxt</code> and <code>mafromtxt</code> were both
deprecated in v1.17 - users should use <code>numpy.genfromtxt</code> instead with
the appropriate value for the <code>usemask</code> parameter.</p>

<h2>v1.21.0</h2>
<h1>NumPy 1.21.0 Release Notes</h1>
<p>The NumPy 1.21.0 release highlights are</p>
<ul>
<li>continued SIMD work covering more functions and platforms,</li>
<li>initial work on the new dtype infrastructure and casting,</li>
<li>universal2 wheels for Python 3.8 and Python 3.9 on Mac,</li>
<li>improved documentation,</li>
<li>improved annotations,</li>
<li>new <code>PCG64DXSM</code> bitgenerator for random numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition there are the usual large number of bug fixes and other
improvements.</p>
<p>The Python versions supported for this release are 3.7-3.9. Official
support for Python 3.10 will be added when it is released.</p>
<p>:warning:  Warning: there are unresolved problems compiling NumPy 1.21.0 with gcc-11.1 .</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimization level <code>-O3</code> results in many wrong warnings when running the tests.</li>
<li>On some hardware NumPy will hang in an infinite loop.</li>
</ul>
<h2>New functions</h2>
<h3>Add PCG64DXSM BitGenerator</h3>
<p>Uses of the PCG64 BitGenerator in a massively-parallel context have
been shown to have statistical weaknesses that were not apparent at the
first release in numpy 1.17. Most users will never observe this weakness
and are safe to continue to use PCG64. We have introduced a new
PCG64DXSM BitGenerator that will eventually become the new default
BitGenerator implementation used by <code>default_rng</code> in future releases.
PCG64DXSM solves the statistical weakness while preserving the
performance and the features of PCG64.</p>
<p>See <code>upgrading-pcg64</code> for more details.</p>
<p>(<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/numpy/numpy/pull/18906"">gh-18906</a>)</p>
<h2>Expired deprecations</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <code>shape</code> argument <code>numpy.unravel_index</code> cannot be
passed as <code>dims</code> keyword argument anymore. (Was deprecated in NumPy
1.16.)</li>
</ul>
