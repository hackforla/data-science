    "# District Mapping Tool for H4LA Projects\n",
    "(work in progress!)\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "At Hack for LA (H4LA), our projects often require the visualization of data points on maps to provide insights and facilitate analysis. To enhance this capability across our projects, we're developing a tool that leverages District Files. This tool aims to automate and simplify the process of rendering geographic data points on maps, making it easier for contributors and stakeholders to get data and view the data within the context of specific districts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this tool is to serve as a reusable resource for H4LA projects that involve mapping and geographic data visualization. By integrating District Files, we can offer a more granular and insightful view of the data, allowing for district-specific analyses and visualizations. This not only improves the accuracy of our projects but also enhances the user experience by providing more relevant and localized information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The automated tool will interface with District Files to render geographic data points based on the project's needs. It will be designed for flexibility, allowing customization to fit the specific requirements of each H4LA project and will be easily accessable in GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build something great together!\n",
