Project idea from Karina to examine accessibility to green spaces (parks, public beaches, etc.) within the City of LA. Ideas include:
  - Combining metro/crime (e..g, vehicle crash data) data sets to see how accessible (transportation-wise) third green spaces are for the broad population. 
  - Examine population density info get a sense of the size of parks x population it’s serving in a mile-radius. Analysis can be helpful in many (deciding where to hold public events, determine underserved areas for new green spaces, etc)

### Data Sources Starting Point
Some data sources to start exploration can be found here:
- [LA Metro dataset](https://developer.metro.net/gis-data/)
- [LA City Parks](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwik1LT4oKeEAxUtMUQIHeT5DJMQFnoECBUQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdata.lacity.org%2FParks-Recreation%2FDepartment-of-Recreation-and-Parks-GIS-Map-of-Park%2Fnuub-r4zx&usg=AOvVaw0ixMbMAc7m57sctXQOpKht&opi=89978449)
- [LA census data ](https://data.census.gov/table?g=050XX00US06037)

_Additional Data sources may be used for this project._ 

### Next steps
- [ ] Decide if this should be one issue or multiple. 
- [ ] Decide on what additional analyses we can do
- [ ] Complete Project Proposal outlining: Objective, Expected Deliverable(s), Data Sources & Limitations, Research outline. Ideally, proposal should outline possible stakeholder(s) (e.g, LA resident, city council) of project deliverables.

We want to analyze arrest data for the city of Los Angeles, and incorporate data from other sources, to determine its suitability for further analysis by Hack for LA. More information about the data, from the [Controller's office website]():
- The LAPD arrest types fall into five categories identified by the LAPD: (1) felony, (2) misdemeanor, (3) infractions, (4) dependent, and (5) other.
- Under California law, a felony is a crime that is punishable with death, by imprisonment in the state prison, 
or . . . by imprisonment in a county jail under [certain provisions]. Every other crime or public offense is a misdemeanor except those offenses that are classified as infractions.  Misdemeanors and infractions carry varying degrees of financial and incarceration consequences.
- LAPD makes more arrests for misdemeanor and infraction offenses than for felonies.
   - 2019: 55,954 misdemeanor & infraction arrests vs. 33,663 felony arrests
   - 2020: 34,659 misdemeanor & infraction arrests vs. 31,015 felony arrests
   - 2021: 33,179 misdemeanor & infraction arrests vs. 32,597 felony arrests

### Overview
We want to analyze eviction data for the city of Los Angeles, and incorporate data from other sources, to determine whether there are actions local leaders can take to address the problem. The following background information is from the [LA Controller's website](https://controller.lacity.gov/landings/evictions):
- August 1, 2023 – rent owed from March 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020 is due. If the Declaration of COVID-19-Related Financial Distress form was returned to the landlord within 15 days of rent being due, they cannot be evicted for nonpayment of rent.
- February 1, 2024 – rent owed from October 1, 2021 to January 31, 2023 is due. If a tenant returned the Declaration of COVID-19-Related Financial Distress form to the landlord within 15 days of rent being due AND paid 25% of rent owed from this period, they cannot be evicted for nonpayment of rent.
- However, since March 27, 2023, landlords may not evict a tenant who falls behind in rent unless the tenant owes an amount higher than the Fair Market Rent (FMR). The FMR depends on the bedroom size of the rental unit.

### Overview
We want to build a library of various local data sources so that we can initiate new data science projects for volunteers that will be useful for the local community. The LA Controller's office seems to have quite a few.

### Action Items
- [ ] Visit the LA City Controller's website (link below in resources) and create a list of data sets available.
- [ ] Find contact information from the Controller's website and get in touch with someone at the office to determine if real time data is available for the public to access. Examples are eviction and LAPD arrest data, which we have historical data for (links below).
- [ ] Document any correspondence with city representatives in a comment below.
- [ ] If real time data is available, add links to the Resources section.  

### Resources
[LA City Controller Website](https://controller.lacity.gov/data) - In the ""Data Sites"" section there are various resources that should be looked at to determine which may be of interest to Hack for LA

We need to survey labels across the organization so that we can rationalize and do automation and org-wide audits.

#### Additional Details
We already have an automation running on the github.com/hackforla/website repo that adds labels that start with ""missing:"" and let the user know what other labels are required.  The user can still add optional labels, but they must use the minimum.  We want to roll this automation out to all the teams, but in order to do so, they must all be uses the minimum labeling in the same way.

We have a [kanban guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Fe7mNdmPBP5bD_yLJ1C0_I1TmoK47AuHHrdhdDyWCs/), but it's confusing to users if all the projects don't use similar labels, so we want to have a base set of labels that will be documented in our instructions.

### Action Items
- [x] Define data schema
- [x] Create spreadsheet 
- [x] Write a script that gets a list of all labels for each repo across all orgs controlled by hack for la 
- [x] Find main label types
- [ ] Analysis by appearance
- [ ] Release dependency on hackforla/ops#15

#### Data Schema
- name of org

- type of label (role, size, priority, difficulty/complexity, status, feature, p-feature, etc)
- number of issues per label

We need to have minimum standards for structured context in data sets we create and or deploy in our projects so that we can help consumers understand the context from which they come.

### Action Items
- [ ] Identify existing resources for structured context, adding each example as a link in the resources section
   - [ ] Once done, remove the ""TG: Gather Examples"" label and add the ""TG: Draft Template"" label
- [ ] Create a draft template, in all the formats the data will come in (json, csv, etc.) and upload to repo as a pr in the folder structured-context
    - [ ] Once done, remove the ""TG: Draft Template"" label and add the ""TG: Create Guide"" label
- [ ] Discuss plan with data science team
- [ ] Create a guide on how to use the template 
   - [ ] Once done, remove the ""TG: Create Guide"" label and add the ""TG: Review Guide"" label
- [ ] Review the guide with product management communities of practice
   - [ ] Once done, remove the ""TG: Review Guide"" label and add the ""TG: Leadership Review"" label
- [ ] Present to Hack for LA leadership team for sign off
   - [ ] Once approved, remove the ""TG: Leadership Review"" label and add the ""TG: Place Guide"" label
- [ ] Possibly create an issue template on .github 
   - [ ] Include link to template under resources if you add it as a template in .github

We need to create a tool so that each project at H4LA that renders points on a map can use District Files to help people analyze or view the data. 

## Action Items
- [x] Identify large groups/districts 
- [x] Identify links for groups/districts
- [x] Locate and obtain shape files for these districts #124 
- [x] Determine what files types we will make these available (shp, npm, and/or GeoJSON)
- [ ] Put files in GitHub repository so they are available to use in the organization.
- [x] research how we will create a data set out of this info that will be self updating (meaning are there apis for these groups)
- [ ] ...
